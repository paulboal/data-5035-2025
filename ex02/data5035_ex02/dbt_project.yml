# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the dq_checks/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

# We also have a seed file. You can load this manually into Snowflake
# but you can also include it here and create this example table 
# as a seed table instead.  Usually seeds are for static config data
# but we're using it for our testing here for simplicity.
