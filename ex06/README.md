# Exercise 6: Using Web Services Programmatically

## Part 1 - Programming

For the first part of this exercise, we’ll use the World Bank Documents & Reports web services API found here: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/api

Our objective is to create a program that regularly ingests a list of documents related to hydrogen powered transportation.

You’ll need to write a Python program to query the API, retrieve the results in JSON format, and reformat those results into a tabular format. Extract enough information from the API so we can understand basic information about each document like the identifier, title, author, publication date, etc. You do not need to retrieve every field, just those you think are helpful for a research catalog.

Note that you WILL need to retrieve all pages of results, not just the first page.


## Part 2 - Personal Research

For second part, you'll need to do some searching on the web or inquiry with an AI source to find information about some possible web services that could be useful for one of your own personal projects. You will need to identify two web service API data sources and answer the following questions. You should try to write around 250-500 works for each of the data sources.

1. What is the source? Include the name of the entity and the URL where the API is documented.
2. How would you imaging using this source in a project? What data does it have that would be useful to your project?
3. What challenges can you imagine encountering when working with this API? Be as descripitive as you can.
